# Stacks
A stack is an ordered collection of elements where elements are only added and removed from the same end. In the physical world, an example of a stack would be a stack of plates in a kitchen - you add plates or remove plates from the top of the pile. In the software world, a good example of a stack is the history of your current browser's tab. Let's say you're on site A, and you click on a link to go to site B, then from B you click on another link to go to site C. Every time you click a link, you are adding to the stack - your history is now [A, B, C]. When you click the back arrow, you are "removing" from the stack - click it once and you have [A, B], click it again and you have [A].

Another term used to describe stacks is LIFO, which stands for last in, first out. The last (most recent) element placed inside is the first element to come out.

Stacks are very simple to implement. Some languages like Java have built-in stacks. In Python, you can just use a list stack = [] and use stack.append(element) and stack.pop(). In fact, any dynamic array can implement a stack. Typically, inserting into a stack is called pushing and removing from a stack is called popping. Stacks will usually also come with operations like peek, which means looking at the element at the top of the stack.
